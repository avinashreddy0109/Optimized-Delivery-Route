# Optimized Delivery Route Planning with Traffic Congestion Simulation

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for optimized delivery route planning using **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** techniques while incorporating **traffic congestion simulation**. The goal is to reduce travel time, minimize costs, and improve efficiency for logistics and delivery operations.

## Features
- **Traffic Congestion Simulation**: Simulates various traffic conditions based on the time of day (peak hours, off-peak hours).
- **Route Optimization**: Utilizes the **TSP approximation algorithm** to find the most efficient route based on travel time and traffic conditions.
- **Visualization**: Displays the optimized delivery route on an interactive map.
- **Cost and Time Analysis**: Calculates the total delivery time and estimated costs (e.g., fuel, time).

## Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **networkx**: For graph algorithms and TSP optimization.
- **folium**: For visualizing routes on a map.
- **pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **matplotlib**: For plotting cost and time analysis.

## Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/optimized-delivery-route.git
    cd optimized-delivery-route
    ```

2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Traffic Congestion Simulation**: Simulates traffic conditions at different times of the day.
    - Peak hours (e.g., 8-9 AM, 5-6 PM) result in increased travel time.
    - Off-peak hours have no additional delays.
   
2. **Route Optimization**: The system uses the **TSP algorithm** to optimize the delivery route and minimize travel time and costs.

3. **Route Visualization**: The optimized route is visualized on an interactive **folium** map, showing delivery points and the optimal path between them.

4. **Running the Code**: Execute the Python script to generate the optimized delivery route:
    ```bash
    python optimized_route.py
    ```
    This will output an HTML file (`optimized_route_map.html`) with the visualized optimized route.

## Example Output
- **Interactive Map**: Displays the delivery points and the optimized route on a map.
- **Console Output**: Provides the total travel time and estimated delivery costs.
